## ABOUT ELLIPSISUI 2.x FOR KODI 19 MATRIX
The aim with EllipsisUI is to resurrect and improve Ellipsis by Team Blackbolt. EllipsisUI is a fork of the original Ellipsis project. The original goal for Ellipsis was to make the navigation and use of Kodi as user friendly as possible, so easy to use infact that a young child can use it just as easily as her grandmother can.
